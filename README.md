# Project 1a/b:
Read mapping. Detecting subsitutions, insertions, and deletions in a test genome given a reference genome.

# Project 2a/b:
Transcription factor detection. Given a dataset of bound sequences and not-bound sequences, and a test file of unknown sequences, write a program that can predict whether a sequence is bound or not bound.
My approach: Gibbs sampling. Also possible: ML/logistic regression, expectation maximization.
